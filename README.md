# GD_SNAP

##Requirements

qutip 
qgrad :  https://github.com/qgrad/qgrad/tree/master

##About

This is a code using Gradient descent to optimize the values of the SNAP operator (from quantum optics), and then check that you can obtain the fock state |1> only with displacements and with the SNAP operators. FInally this compare the fidelity obtained with the library of qutip and the one of qgrad.
