# GD_SNAP

## Requirements

- qutip 

- qgrad :  https://github.com/qgrad/qgrad/tree/master
- Jax

## About

This is a code using Gradient descent to optimize the values of the SNAP operator (from quantum optics), and then check that you can obtain the fock state |1> only with displacements and with the SNAP operators. Finally, this compares the fidelity obtained with the qutip library and the qgrad one.
